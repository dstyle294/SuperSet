# SuperSet: The new way to workout

It's not just a workout tracker. It's also:
* Social media platform with **personalized posts** from friends
* Interactive exercise repository, with **detailed instructions and embedded GiFs**
* Workout sharing platform, allowing you to copy your friend's workouts'
* And much more (soon üôè)



This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with React Native/TypeScript used for the frontend, and Javascript/Node.js for the [backend](https://github.com/dstyle294/SuperSetBackend). 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
